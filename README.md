# qbRayTrace

Welcome to my new series on building a ray tracer from scratch in C++ with the SDL2 library! Follow me in this 'code with me' style series as I build a simple but functional ray tracer from scratch in C++. As far as possible, I use only the standard libraries, with the addition of SDL2 to allow the display of the final image in a window. Note that the SDL2 library is not included here, you will have to obtain and install that yourself from the SDL2 website in order to use the qbRayTrace code.

The code corresponding to each episode of the video series is in the corresponding sub-folder, so Ep1Code for episode 1, Ep2Code for episode 2 and so on. Each of these is intended to be stand-alone and the code for that specific episode can be compiled with the makefile in the folder and run.

This code is intended to be primarily for educational purposes and to be studied alongside the corresponding videos on the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel.

As the code corresponds to specific episodes of the series, pull requests will not be accepted.

## Episode 1

In this first episode I give a basic introduction to how ray tracing works and then go on to put together the basic code that is going to form the core structure of the final project.

## Episode 2

In this episode I go over the basic geometry of the virtual camera that we use to actually make ray tracing work. We take a look at the basic geometry and how it works and then go on to look at how to implement that in C++ code.

Note that for this episode and beyond, the qbLinAlg repository code is also included.

## Episode 3

This episode focuses on ray-sphere intersection and the problem of how to compute the location of the intersection. We then go on to look at how to write code to actual implement this to allow us to produce our first, very simple, image of a sphere shaded by distance from the camera.
